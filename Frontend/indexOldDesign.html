                <p class="paboutus1">We are living in uncertain times where nature’s calamities are truly unavoidable and what is worse, frequently unexpected. Under such uncertainties, the only thing we can do is to be as prepared as possible. Material things that we have
                    worked hard for and accumulated could all be gone within a blink of an eye, if such calamities like earthquakes, typhoons or storm surges occur and yet they still pale in comparison when compared to the value of our life and the lives
                    of our loved ones which are irreplaceable.</p>
                <p class="paboutus1">With that in mind, LifeKit was developed with our motto “Be Prepared. Life Matters!” because it means exactly just that. We cannot take for granted anymore nor procrastinate in getting ourselves prepared to face such potential calamities.
                    We cannot put a price tag on the value of our life and the lives of those we love.</p>
